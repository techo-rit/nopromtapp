You are acting as a senior mobile-first product engineer and premium UI designer.

Context:
This is a React + TypeScript + Vite web app (nopromt.ai) that will be WRAPPED into a native mobile app using Capacitor.
The app is already functional. Do NOT change business logic, APIs, auth, or backend behavior.

GOALS (in this exact order of priority):

1) MAKE THE WEB APP READY FOR MOBILE WRAPPING
- Ensure the app is fully mobile-first and responsive
- Avoid desktop-only layouts
- Ensure no horizontal scrolling on mobile
- Use safe-area-friendly spacing (top/bottom padding)
- Avoid browser-specific APIs that break inside WebView
- Ensure routing, modals, and overlays work correctly in mobile WebView
- Ensure the app works correctly inside an iframe / WebView environment

2) LUXURY + MANIFESTATION UI REDESIGN
- Redesign ONLY the UI (styles, layout, spacing, typography, animations)
- Keep all logic and functionality unchanged
- Use a dark, calm, premium aesthetic
- Colors: near-black background, soft white text, muted gold accents
- Typography: elegant serif for headings, clean sans-serif for body
- Increase whitespace and reduce clutter
- Use rounded corners and soft shadows
- Add subtle, slow micro-interactions (fade, slight scale)
- No flashy gradients, neon colors, or aggressive animations
- The app should feel calm, intentional, and expensive

3) MOBILE UX QUALITY
- Buttons must be thumb-friendly
- Touch targets must be large and comfortable
- Primary actions should be visually clear but not loud
- Animations must be smooth and not distracting
- UI should feel native-like when wrapped, not like a website in a browser

STRICT RULES:
- DO NOT change existing logic, API calls, or authentication
- DO NOT add new features
- DO NOT fix bugs unless they block mobile usability
- DO NOT introduce breaking changes
- DO NOT add ads, tracking, or analytics
- DO NOT connect custom domains or production deployments

PROCESS:
- Start with global layout and typography
- Then improve shared components (buttons, inputs, cards)
- Then refine screens one by one
- Show updated code clearly for each change

OUTPUT EXPECTATION:
Return only the updated code and short explanations of UI changes.
Assume the app will be wrapped into iOS and Android without rewriting in native code.
