Implement a GLOBAL mobile interaction rule:
Replace all desktop hover-based UI effects with focus-based behavior on mobile.

GOAL:
On mobile devices, any UI element that relies on hover for emphasis
should instead use a focus-based visual state when the element becomes prominent or active.

This must apply across the entire app.

INTERACTION MODEL:

1) DESKTOP (UNCHANGED)
- Keep all existing :hover styles and behaviors
- Hover remains the primary interaction mechanism
- No changes to desktop UX

2) MOBILE (NEW BEHAVIOR)
- Disable hover-dependent effects on mobile
- Introduce a "focused" state as the mobile equivalent of hover

FOCUS SHOULD ACTIVATE WHEN:
- An element becomes the primary item in view (scroll-based focus)
- An element is the snap target after guided scrolling
- An element is tapped or receives interaction intent

FOCUS DETECTION RULES:
- Use IntersectionObserver for scroll-based focus
- Element is considered focused when:
  - 60–70% visible in viewport
  - OR visually centered / dominant
- Only ONE focused element per interaction group at a time

3) VISUAL TREATMENT (FOCUS STATE)
The focus state should mirror hover styling:
- Subtle scale or elevation
- Soft glow or accent border
- Slight background emphasis
- Calm, premium animation (slow in / slow out)

No aggressive effects.
No flashing.
No large motion.

4) BEHAVIOR RULES
- Focus must NOT block scrolling
- Focus must fade naturally as user scrolls away
- Focus must not require a tap to appear
- User input always overrides focus (tap wins)

5) TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS
- Apply only on mobile breakpoints (<768px)
- Use CSS classes or data attributes to toggle focus state
- Avoid continuous scroll listeners
- Prefer IntersectionObserver for performance
- Fully compatible with WebView / Capacitor

6) CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENT
This rule must apply consistently to:
- Cards
- Buttons with hover emphasis
- Grid items
- Interactive previews
- Any component that currently relies on hover

STRICT RULES:
- Do not change layouts
- Do not add new UI elements
- Do not alter routing or logic
- Do not redesign components
- Do not make multiple elements focused at once

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
On desktop, the app feels interactive via hover.
On mobile, the app feels guided via focus.
The user should never miss hover on mobile.
